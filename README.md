## Hallo!❤️

I'm a CSE undergrad student, learning to code by mingling it with my interests. 

Currently working on: 
- A national hackathon with some friends across colleges!
- A personal project (a discord bot for my own uses!)
- A SECOND personal project (website for personal use + easy way to learn front end)

Currently learning:
- Python/C/Javascript/ML Basics

Nice to have you here! Catch me forgetting to add repos all the time and then spam adding them altogether.
